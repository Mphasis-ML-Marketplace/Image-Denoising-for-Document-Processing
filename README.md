# Image-Denoising-for-Document-Processing

## Product Overview

Noised Images is a serious problem across industries like insurance claims, legal documents etc ., which happens due to multitude of reasons like sensor defects, environment factors like low light or bright light conditons. These noises can be dots, lines and smudges that add extra unwanted pixel values to our raw image pixels. For example, if you take/scan a photo in camera, due to poor lighting conditions, there will be shadows (dark patches / pixels) in our original raw image. Our denoising solution leverages deep learning techniques to achieve high-quality denoising results in these noisy documents. The solution is highly suitable for document preprocessing step in many downstream systems like OCR, contextual visual document QA etc.

## Highlights

This solution can be used to correct noises in pixels which occur while compressing images or scanning a document with scanner or phone. This solution can be applied for document analysis in business scenarios such as customer onboarding, insurance broker submissions, financial statement analysis, KYC, Contract analysis, OCR entities extraction, etc.

This solution incorporates CNN models trained on a large dataset of documents which can identify image noising issues with a document and correct those issues.
